Hi, 
Welcome to my blog about my final year project. I will update this blog on a weekly basis with my progress.

## Project Description

Quiz generator is a machine learning project. The goal of the project is to create software that will automatically generate a quiz on a text that is provided as an input. The software will test a user's knowledge on any given text by creating a set of questions about the text with a set of appropriate incorrect/correct answers.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from my dissatisfaction with my pre-university education experience.  
Learning is a compelling activity and spending time in school should be exciting. After all, learning is a key part of being a human. But in reality, going to school is something that the majority of students dread. 
I believe that standardization and the one-fits-all model is what makes school so unappealing. A personalized learning path should be a crucial part of education. A system that allows a pupil to learn at its own pace with an option to deep dive into some subjects is a vision of mine. Building the whole system is out of the scope for this project, but one challenge that would need to be overcome in such a system is testing. This allows each student to be tested on any subject at any point. 
This is the part that I will be working on in my final year project.

## Aims

I aim to create a stand-alone application that will produce a quiz based on any given text. 
- Questions will be generated based on the most important sentences in the text;
- The system will generate four possible answer choices. Three out of them being on a similar topic but not correct. One answer will be picked out of the text;

## Additional goals

Given a limited amount of time if I managed to complete the base aims, these are the additional task I will work on implementing as they appear in order: 
1. Allowing a user to pick a topic (rather entering text) for a quiz. The text will be pulled from online sources such as Wikipedia;
2. Creating a web application where the system could be hosted;
