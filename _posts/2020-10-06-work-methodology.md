## Software development lifecycle methodology
For the purpose of this developing the project, Agile SCRUM methodology was chosen. Originally this method is for small 
teams so during this project an adapted version will be used. This framework was picked for a few reasons - I have 
experience with it and it is adaptive. Iterative deployment and adapting the technique of working allows me to continuously 
develop the software and my way of developing it.

The work is organized in short bursts called sprints. Each sprint 
will be one week with one bigger goal set for it. Each of these goals is divided into stories (task) that should not 
take more than a day to complete.

As listed down in a SCRUM guide (https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf) these 
four events will be used: 
- Sprint Planning (picking a goal from the backlog) 
- Daily Scrum (review of the previous day, and sorting out tasks for the day) 
- Sprint Review (review what was completed, what tasks need to be moved to another sprint) 
- Sprint Retrospective (understand what when well, what needs to be improved)
